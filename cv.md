## Experience

I am relatively new to Frontend, having started only in June 2023. Ever since I started my programming path I have been working on small pet and freelance projects in order to master the basics and create solid foundation for further learning and practice. As part of “Frontend Developer” course at IT Girls school several websites and apps have been created ranging from plain HTML/CSS layouts and a fully-functioning JS/Firebase Coffee shop app.

A small memo cards app in React is my current work-in-progress project.
